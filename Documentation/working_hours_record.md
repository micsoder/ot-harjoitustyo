|:---------|:---------|:---------|
| 8.11 | 1 | I familiarized myself with the instructions and I created the Documentation folder with the requirements and working hour record files. |
| 9.11 | 3 | I finished the requirements file and did a ui sketch. |
| 15.11 | 6 | I familiarized myself with customtkinter and I did build the skeleton of the project.|
| 16.11 | 6 | I created the first two customtkinter frames, the create account ad login frame.|
| 17.11 | 8 | I created the create account and login logic so that the users are saved in a database.|
| 22.11 | 6 | I started with creating the logic that saves the things added by the user to a table so that when the program is reopened, the information appears in the textbox.|
| 23.11 | 8 | I continued with the logic and wrote some tests.|
| 24.11 | 5 | I did the documentation etc and tried my program in Cubbli.|
| 30.11 | 8 | I started to research how I should implement the function that zooms in on places on the map. Started on one idea where the user creates a polygon on the map by clicking on the mouse but I did not succeed with this|
| 1.12 | 8 | Because I did not succeed with the original idea, I had to come up with something else which was to create a bar from where the user can add zones and show zones.|
| 2.12 | 5 | I did the tests, documentation, Github release and tried my program in Cubbli.|
| 6.12 | 8 | I create the show zone logic|
| 7.12 | 8 | I continued on the show zone logic and created the exit map view and go back logic.|
| 10.22 | 4 | I did some test fixing, documentation, and instruction manual and tried my program in Cubbli.|
| 21.12 | 6 | Added docstrings, made methods private, and added code that gives an error message if the filename is not found in assets folder.|
| 22.22 | 8 | I have done some refactoring, added admin right and done some documenting and testing. Done the last release and fixed the program ready for submission.|
