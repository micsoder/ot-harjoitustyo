## Functional requirements

### The aim of the program

The aim of this program is to aid the process of game development. The main feature of this program is the ability to add information to a conceptual game map. The map data may consist of location information, information about the NPCs (non-playable characters), extra map layers, etc. 

### The users

There will be both an admin and a normal user, where the admin will have the right to do anything while the normal user's modification rights are limited.

### User Interface (UI)

### What can be done in the program

#### Before login
- When the program is opened, the user is greeted by a login page
- On the login page, the user can create an account or log in if the user already has an account
- The user can log in by adding their username and password. If the username or password is wrong or cannot be found, then a message about that will appear

#### After login
- The user sees the first map page which is the most zoomed-out map view of the game map. On the right side of the page, there is a dashboard where information added to the map is viewed.
- By mouse left-clicking, the map view zooms in on the particular place where the mouse is, and by mouse right-clicking, the map view zooms out.
- By ctrl + right-click on a specific spot on the map, a drop-down menu appears which states the objects that can be added to the map on that location.
Example object that can be added to the map:
  * Information about a certain place
  * A short story/ lore about a location
  * NPCs
  * Quests

- Also, additional map layers containing specific information can be layered on the base map. The base map and the additional layers are not made in the program, they are imported into the program and made in a different software.
- After the user is ready with adding something or just viewing, the user can logout and thus the page is returned the the login page.
